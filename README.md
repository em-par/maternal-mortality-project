# Maternal Mortality in the U.S.

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that explores a dataset on maternal mortality in the United States.  
It uses Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to clean the data and create data visualizations that highlight key trends.  

## What's included
- `python_project_maternal_mortality_US.ipynb` — the main notebook with analysis and visualizations  
- `data/mmr.csv` — public dataset used in the analysis  

## This notebook shows:
- Loading and working with structured data in Python  
- Creating meaningful charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Communicating results through visual storytelling  

## Data
The dataset is included in this repo for convenience:  
- **File:** `data/mmr.csv`  
- **Source:** [CDC Maternal Mortality Data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-maternal-deaths-rates.htm) (publicly available)  

## How to view
- You can open the notebook directly on GitHub to see the code and charts.
